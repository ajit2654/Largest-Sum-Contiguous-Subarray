# Largest-Sum-Contiguous-Subarray
Simple idea of the Kadaneâ€™s algorithm is to look for all positive contiguous segments of the array.
Keep track of maximum sum contiguous segment among all positive segments.
Each time we get a positive sum compare it with max_current and update max_global if it is greater than max_global.
Lets take the example:
[-2,3,2,-1]
[-2,3,2,-2,5,4]
for i=0 a[0]=-2
max_current=max(a[0],max_current+a[i)
max_current=max(-2,-2+3)=1
set max_current=1 
max_current=max(-2,2+3)=5 
set max_current=5 and compare with max_global if greater than max_current then assign into max_global.
This is known as kadane's algorithm.
